PDF Data Scraping and Summarization Project
Project Overview
This project involves extracting data from PDF documents using Python scripts, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to summarize the extracted data into structured and concise text, and connecting the project to a PostgreSQL database to store the summarized data in tabular form.

Key Components
PDF Data Scraping

Python scripts are used to scrape data from PDF documents, extracting relevant information.
NLP Summarization

NLP models are employed to summarize the extracted data into concise and structured text that can be readily stored within database tables.
PostgreSQL Database

PostgreSQL is used as the database management system to store the summarized data in organized tables.
Project Workflow
Python scripts extract data from PDF documents, capturing the necessary information.

Extracted data is processed and summarized using NLP models, creating structured text summaries.

The summarized data is stored within PostgreSQL database tables.

Technology Stack
Data Extraction:

Python (PDF parsing libraries)
NLP Summarization:

NLP models (e.g., spaCy, GPT-3, BERT)
Database:

PostgreSQL
Project Setup
To set up and run this project:

Ensure Python and the required libraries for PDF parsing and NLP are installed.

Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure database connection settings in your Python script.

Implement PDF scraping scripts to extract data from PDF documents.

Utilize NLP models to summarize the extracted data.

Establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database and create appropriate tables for data storage.

Run your project to automate the data extraction, summarization, and storage process.

Conclusion
This project combines data extraction from PDFs, NLP-based summarization, and PostgreSQL database integration to efficiently capture and store structured information. It offers a streamlined solution for handling large volumes of PDF data and converting it into organized, manageable text.
